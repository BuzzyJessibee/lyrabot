# LyraBot
A Discord bot made to learn JavaScript - A little piece of Lyra's soul

_**Code is uploaded here for preservation and ease of access, please don't use it without asking me first**_

This bot was written with Discord.js v13 + @discordjs/voice

This bot was created for fun for me to learn Node JavaScript and just has a bunch of random features that I thought were cool.

Previous DJS v12 iteration can be found in the branch lyrabot-v3
