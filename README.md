# LyraBot V3
A Discord bot made to learn JavaScript - A little piece of Lyra's soul

_**Code is uploaded here for preservation and ease of access, please don't use it without asking me first**_

This bot was written with Discord.js v12 + Commando and uses:
- canvacord
- discord-music-player
- discord-paginationembed
- discord-xp

This bot was created for fun for me to learn Node JavaScript and just has a bunch of random features that I thought were cool.
